# Timeline App

The Timeline app is a web application that allows you to create and customize timelines. Timelines are a visual representation of events or points in time, often used to showcase a series of events in a chronological order. With this app, you can easily create, configure, and manage your own timeline.

## Features

- **Create Timelines:** Add new timeline points with titles, descriptions, and order.

- **Reorder Timeline Points:** Change the order of timeline points to rearrange your events.

- **Delete Timeline Points:** Remove unwanted events from your timeline.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/felixghislaindev/timeline.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```
   cd timeline-app
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the App:**

   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open in your Browser:** The app should be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. **Adding Timeline Points:** Click the "Add" button to create a new timeline point. Fill in the title, description, and the order you want it to appear in the timeline.

2. **Reordering Timeline Points:** In the timeline configuration section, use the "Item Position" dropdown to change the order of timeline points.

3. **Deleting Timeline Points:** In the timeline configuration section, click the trash bin icon to delete a timeline point.

4. **Viewing Your Timeline:** Scroll down to see your timeline. Click on the circular points to toggle their click state and highlight them.

5. **Responsive Design:** The app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

6. **Empty Timeline Message:** If you don't have any timeline points, you'll see a message indicating that you can create your timeline.
